ATTACK REPORT Web Application Penetration Testing Lab (DVWA)

Author: Mechac Ndikuna Environment: Isolated Virtual Lab (VMware +
VirtualBox) Attacker Machine: Kali Linux Target: DVWA (Damn Vulnerable
Web Application) Date: 2026

DISCLAIMER: This laboratory was conducted in a controlled environment
for educational purposes only.

  ----------------------
  1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
  ----------------------

This report documents the security assessment performed against a
vulnerable web application (DVWA). The objective was to identify and
exploit common web vulnerabilities in a controlled lab environment.

The following attacks were successfully executed:

-   SQL Injection
-   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

  --------------------
  2. LAB ENVIRONMENT
  --------------------

Infrastructure: - Domain Controller (Windows Server) - Client Machines
(Windows 10) - Kali Linux (Attacker) - DVWA hosted on local web server

Security Level configured to: LOW

  -----------------------------
  3. ATTACK 1 – SQL INJECTION
  -----------------------------

Vulnerability Type: SQL Injection

Payload Used: 1’ OR ‘1’=’1

Description: The application failed to properly sanitize user input. The
injected SQL logic altered the backend query logic and bypassed
authentication mechanisms.

Impact: - Unauthorized data retrieval - Authentication bypass -
Potential full database compromise

Risk Level: HIGH

Mitigation: - Use prepared statements - Input validation - Parameterized
queries - Web Application Firewall (WAF)

  ------------------------------------------
  4. ATTACK 2 – CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING (XSS)
  ------------------------------------------

Vulnerability Type: Reflected XSS

Payload Used:
Advanced Payload:
Description: The application reflected unsanitized user input directly
into the browser response. This allowed execution of arbitrary
JavaScript in the victim’s browser.

Impact: - Session hijacking - Cookie theft - Phishing attacks - Content
manipulation

Risk Level: HIGH

Mitigation: - Output encoding - Content Security Policy (CSP) - Input
filtering - Secure cookie flags (HttpOnly, Secure)

  ----------------------------
  5. OVERALL RISK ASSESSMENT
  ----------------------------

The web application demonstrates critical security weaknesses. If
deployed in production, it would be vulnerable to:

-   Data breaches
-   Account takeover
-   Privilege escalation

Immediate remediation is required.

  ---------------
  6. CONCLUSION
  ---------------

This lab demonstrates the importance of secure coding practices.
Developers must validate, sanitize, and properly handle user input.
Security testing should be integrated into the development lifecycle.
